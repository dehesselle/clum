# Centralized Local User Management
## About
You have a lot of Linux boxes running local authentication only, you do not want to use a directory service like LDAP but also don't want to constantly add and remove users on each and every box by hand?

[clum](https://github.com/dehesselle/clum) is a small collection of ansible tasks and helper scripts that offer you to have this one big list of all your users and groups and to assign them to any server.

## TBD
documentation is not ready yet
- Ansible >= 2.4
